```
Scenario 1: Successfully Unfollow User

Details:
  Description: This test scenario checks if the function successfully unfollows a user when all conditions are met.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a mock context with a valid user ID and create mock user objects for the current user and the user to unfollow.
    Act: Call the UnfollowUser function with valid parameters.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns a ProfileResponse with the unfollowed user's profile.
  Validation:
    By successfully unfollowing a user, we ensure that the application maintains the correct relationship between users and reflects the changes in the user's following status.

Scenario 2: Unauthenticated User

Details:
  Description: This test scenario validates the behavior when an unauthenticated user tries to unfollow another user.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a mock context without a user ID and create a mock UnfollowRequest.
    Act: Call the UnfollowUser function with the invalid context.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns an Unauthenticated error status.
  Validation:
    It is crucial to prevent unauthorized actions, and this test ensures that the function correctly handles unauthenticated requests.

Scenario 3: Current User Trying to Unfollow Themselves

Details:
  Description: This test scenario checks the function's response when a user attempts to unfollow themselves.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a mock context with a valid user ID and create a mock UnfollowRequest with the same username as the current user.
    Act: Call the UnfollowUser function with the self-unfollow request.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns an InvalidArgument error status.
  Validation:
    Preventing users from following themselves is a logical constraint, and this test confirms that the function enforces this rule.

Scenario 4: Requested User Not Found

Details:
  Description: This test scenario examines the function's behavior when the requested user to unfollow is not found.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a mock context with a valid user ID and create a mock UnfollowRequest with a username of a non-existing user.
    Act: Call the UnfollowUser function with the request to unfollow a non-existing user.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns a NotFound error status.
  Validation:
    Handling scenarios where the requested user does not exist is essential for maintaining data consistency and informing users about the issue.

Scenario 5: Error in Unfollow Operation

Details:
  Description: This test scenario covers the case where an error occurs during the unfollow operation.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a mock context with a valid user ID and create mock user objects for the current user and the user to unfollow.
    Act: Call the UnfollowUser function, but simulate an error during the unfollow operation.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns an Aborted error status.
  Validation:
    Ensuring proper error handling during critical operations like unfollowing users is necessary to maintain data integrity and inform users about any issues.
